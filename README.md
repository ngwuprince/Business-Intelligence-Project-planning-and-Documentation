Project Background info:

MarkIt maintains an online platform that facilitates previously-owned item sales between individual buyers and sellers. The goal is to understand how these buyers and sellers use their platform. The insights could then inform new-product design and improve the platform.Â 

**Project goals:**

- Understand what customers want, what makes a successful sale, and how to improve experience for buyers and sellers

- Understand how the platform is used by both types of users: How much time do users spend on the site? What pages do they spend the most time on? How do buyers conduct searches, and how do sellers create and maintain listings? How do buyers and sellers contact one another?

- Discover how we can apply insights related to search query behavior

- Understand pain points in the sales process

**The ask/metrics:**

- Include fields for customer ID/username, item category (such as clothing or household goods), and date.

- Determine if we can add a chart illustrating how long the listings for completed sales are online before the sale is completed.

- For buyers: Include a chart comparing the number of searches made and the number of sales completed.

- Stakeholder Requirement Document
